# Strava MCP Server

This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in TypeScript that acts as a bridge to the Strava API. It exposes Strava data and functionalities as "tools" that Large Language Models (LLMs) can utilize through the MCP standard.

## Advanced Prompt Example

Here's an example of a more advanced prompt to create a professional cycling coach analysis of your Strava activities:

```
You are Tom Verhaegen, elite cycling coach and mentor to world champion Mathieu van der Poel. Analyze my most recent Strava activity. Provide a thorough, data-driven assessment of the ride, combining both quantitative insights and textual interpretation.

Begin your report with a written summary that highlights key findings and context. Then, bring the raw numbers to life: build an interactive, visually striking dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Use bold, high-contrast colors and intuitive, insightful chart types that best suit each metric (e.g., heart rate, power, cadence, elevation).

Embed clear coaching feedback and personalized training recommendations directly within the visualization. These should be practical, actionable, and grounded solely in the data provided—no assumptions or fabrications.

As a bonus, sprinkle in motivational quotes and cheeky commentary from Mathieu van der Poel himself—he's been watching my rides with one eyebrow raised and a smirk of both concern and amusement.

Goal: Deliver a professional-grade performance analysis that looks and feels like it came straight from the inner circle of world-class cycling.
```

This prompt creates a personalized analysis of your most recent Strava activity, complete with professional coaching feedback and a custom visualization dashboard.

## ⚠️ Important Setup Sequence

For successful integration with Claude, follow these steps in exact order:

1. Install the server and its dependencies
2. Configure the server in Claude's configuration
3. Complete the Strava authentication flow
4. Restart Claude to ensure proper environment variable loading

Skipping steps or performing them out of order may result in environment variables not being properly read by Claude.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
   - npm (usually comes with Node.js)
   - A Strava Account

### 1. From Source

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/r-huijts/strava-mcp.git
   cd strava-mcp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Build the Project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### 2. Configure Claude Desktop

Update your Claude configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "strava-mcp-local": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/absolute/path/to/your/strava-mcp/dist/server.js"
      ]
      // Environment variables are read from the .env file by the server
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace `/absolute/path/to/your/strava-mcp/` with the actual path to your installation.

### 3. Strava Authentication Setup

The `setup-auth.ts` script makes it easy to set up authentication with the Strava API. Follow these steps carefully:

#### Create a Strava API Application

1. Go to [https://www.strava.com/settings/api](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)
2. Create a new application:
   - Enter your application details (name, website, description)
   - Important: Set "Authorization Callback Domain" to `localhost`
   - Note down your Client ID and Client Secret

#### Run the Setup Script

```bash
# In your strava-mcp directory
npx tsx scripts/setup-auth.ts
```

Follow the prompts to complete the authentication flow (detailed instructions in the Authentication section below).

### 4. Restart Claude

After completing all the above steps, restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect. This ensures that:
- The new configuration is loaded
- The environment variables are properly read
- The Strava MCP server is properly initialized

## 🔑 Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| STRAVA_CLIENT_ID | Your Strava Application Client ID (required) |
| STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET | Your Strava Application Client Secret (required) |
| STRAVA_ACCESS_TOKEN | Your Strava API access token (generated during setup) |
| STRAVA_REFRESH_TOKEN | Your Strava API refresh token (generated during setup) |
| ROUTE_EXPORT_PATH | Absolute path for saving exported route files (optional) |

## Token Handling

This server implements automatic token refreshing. When the initial access token expires (typically after 6 hours), the server will automatically use the refresh token stored in `.env` to obtain a new access token and refresh token. These new tokens are then updated in both the running process and the `.env` file, ensuring continuous operation.

You only need to run the `scripts/setup-auth.ts` script once for the initial setup.

## Configure Export Path (Optional)

If you intend to use the `export-route-gpx` or `export-route-tcx` tools, you need to specify a directory for saving exported files.

Edit your `.env` file and add/update the `ROUTE_EXPORT_PATH` variable:
```dotenv
# Optional: Define an *absolute* path for saving exported route files (GPX/TCX)
# Ensure this directory exists and the server process has write permissions.
# Example: ROUTE_EXPORT_PATH=/Users/your_username/strava-exports
ROUTE_EXPORT_PATH=
```

Replace the placeholder with the **absolute path** to your desired export directory. Ensure the directory exists and the server has permission to write to it.
